# REST Service Wizard Tutorial #
Eventually, I will place this template on the Microsoft Store, so that it can be downloaded directly in Visual Studio. However, until then, you will need to download this repository and build the project. I suggest you build it in release mode, but either release or debug will work. Once compiled, using the standard windows explorer, navigate to 

.\RESTTemplate\RESTInstaller\bin\Release

In that folder you will find the file *RESTInstaller.vsix*. Double click on that file to install the Visual Studio extension. Note, you should shut down all instances of Visual Studio before installing.

## Creating a REST Service ##
Once installed, open Visual Studio and select **Create a new project** from the initial popup window. When the Create a new project dialog appears, select WebAPI in the project types dropdown on the top right side of the dialog. When you do, you will see an entry for REST Service (.Net Core) option, with the blue MZ logo next to it.
