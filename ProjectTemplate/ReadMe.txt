Welcome to the $safeprojectname$ REST Service
------------------------------------------------

Creating professional REST services has never been easier. With the REST Wizard, you can create a basic, professional REST
server, literally in minutes. The wizard reads your database to create a set of models, validation skeleton, swagger 
along with examples, and Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) style controllers. In addition, your new REST
API supports the popular Resource Query Language (RQL) to enhance functionality.
